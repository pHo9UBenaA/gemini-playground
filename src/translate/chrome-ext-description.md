A Chrome extension that helps you efficiently manage browser windows by merging
multiple windows into one. (This extension was previously called "Merge Window
Extension.")

You can left-click the extension icon or use Control + M (Command + M on Mac)
to:

- Merge all windows of the same profile
- Merge all incognito windows (if permission is granted for incognito mode)

When merging windows, tab groups and pinned tabs are retained.

### Important

1. For instructions on enabling the extension in incognito mode,\
   see: `https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/13130396`

2. If the shortcut keys do not work, go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` and
   reassign the keys

### Caution

To protect your privacy, regular and incognito windows are not merged.

### Release Note

**v1.1.0**

- Added support for preserving tab groups after merging windows

**v1.2.0**
